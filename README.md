# Currency Converter App

This React Native mobile application provides users with the ability to convert between various currencies. Even lesser-known currencies such as the Armenian dram and Iranian Rial can be converted using this app. The app has a simple and easy-to-use user interface, making it easy for users to navigate and use its features.


## Features

The Currency Converter Mobile App comes with the following features:

-   **Exchange rates**: Users can quickly and easily get the exchange rates of one currency to another. This includes conversion rates for less commonly known currencies, such as the Armenian dram and Iranian Rial.
    
-   **Exchange rate chart**: Users can view a chart that shows the exchange rate history between two currencies. This allows users to see how the exchange rate has changed over time, and make informed decisions about currency conversion.
    
-   **Offline mode**: Even when the user is not online, the app will still work. The last live data that was available when the user was online will be used to provide accurate exchange rates.
    
-   **History page**: The app keeps track of the user's conversion history, so they can easily see the currencies they've converted in the past. The user can also clear their history if they wish.
    
-   **Watchlist**: The user can save their favorite currency pairs to a watchlist. This allows them to quickly check the exchange rate between those two currencies without having to enter them again.
